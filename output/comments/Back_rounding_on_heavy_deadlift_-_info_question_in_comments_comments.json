        "text": "So, this is mad strong. You're lifting 500 without really even wedging in, so it's all going to lumbar. Like, your shoulders are way in front of the bar, and there'san inch between the bar and your legs the whole time. If you learned to wedge your hips in, not only would your low back get some relief, but you'd be able to use your lats better and get 20-30% more weight.\n\nOk, homework. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Qg4Y-f7rH_Y?si=5Ci0_wp1wLpS2dH3) with Chris Duffin. In it, he talks about how the deadlift is a wedge, not a lift, and the potential of learning to wedge. You're just lifting. Now, to learn how to wedge, I like floating the bar. With 135 on the bar, setup at the bottom, and get your lats and erectors tight enough that the weight floats off the ground. No leg drive. Just [back tension](https://imgur.com/a/XvcaVyz). If you're having trouble with this, try leaning back a few inches in a mini trust fall. Once you can float that, do 185, then 225, then 275, etc. Keep going up until you can't float the weight. This is gonna be about 70% of your true 1rm. But above that 70%, when you try to float the weight, instead of the bar coming up, your hips will pull in closer. This is the wedge. It allows your lats and glutes to do the work rather than lumbar. Dave Tate talks about it too [here](https://youtu.be/Uqsjq0zPFe8?si=Qnf0dj6Nf872keZQ). I'm astonished that you can pull 500 just yanking it up.",

I have torn my lumbar in the past and I generally find it difficult to engage my lower back musculature, but the work I did today felt good. \n\nMy all time PR is 500x1, so I worked up to 455lbs for a single (failed double) - it felt light and I feel like it moved well. My back feels completely fine; I\u2019m just curious what an \u201cappropriate or safe\u201d amount of flexion is while doing heavier work like this.",

        "text": "If you address the bar with a neutral spine and consciously attempt to keep that position throughout the movement, you will still get some flexion at loads approaching maximum.  That little bit of flexion is OK.  Excessive flexion is not, I don't care what anyone else says.  If you think you're in excessive flexion, drop the bar.  It's not worth finding out how many degrees of flexion your intervertebral discs and associated ligaments can tolerate before they become injured.",
