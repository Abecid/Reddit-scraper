        "text": "So, this is mad strong. You're lifting 500 without really even wedging in, so it's all going to lumbar. Like, your shoulders are way in front of the bar, and there'san inch between the bar and your legs the whole time. If you learned to wedge your hips in, not only would your low back get some relief, but you'd be able to use your lats better and get 20-30% more weight.\n\nOk, homework. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Qg4Y-f7rH_Y?si=5Ci0_wp1wLpS2dH3) with Chris Duffin. In it, he talks about how the deadlift is a wedge, not a lift, and the potential of learning to wedge. You're just lifting. Now, to learn how to wedge, I like floating the bar. With 135 on the bar, setup at the bottom, and get your lats and erectors tight enough that the weight floats off the ground. No leg drive. Just [back tension](https://imgur.com/a/XvcaVyz). If you're having trouble with this, try leaning back a few inches in a mini trust fall. Once you can float that, do 185, then 225, then 275, etc. Keep going up until you can't float the weight. This is gonna be about 70% of your true 1rm. But above that 70%, when you try to float the weight, instead of the bar coming up, your hips will pull in closer. This is the wedge. It allows your lats and glutes to do the work rather than lumbar. Dave Tate talks about it too [here](https://youtu.be/Uqsjq0zPFe8?si=Qnf0dj6Nf872keZQ). I'm astonished that you can pull 500 just yanking it up.",

That's your deadlift stance.",

Best cue I've heard is from Alan Thrall and it's to keep your knees in the crooks of your elbows. If they're behind,  back off the bar a half inch and wedge more. If they're in front, crowd up on the bar so that it's over your shoe's knot and make sure not to move the bar when you bend down. You want the bar over midfoot, shins touching bar, and knees flush in line with elbows.",

It also suggests that people with generalized 'back pain' (what ever that means) can benefit - in the form of pain reduction -  from rounded back lifting. What is less clear is what should be advised to people like yourself with specific injury history or ongoing specific issues, this is because types and severity of injuries are variable and make quantifying risk/benefits for each type difficult. There does appear to be some suggestion that separating rounding lower backs versus upper backs may help here, where rounding lower back may be more of an issue in those with injury. In my own personal experience (as someone with mild bulging disks and lateral recess stenosis all through L1-S1), I have to keep my lower back straight. Slight rounding with any significant weight will aggravate these disks and more significant tweaks keep me away from the gym for 2 weeks. I personally also find it basically impossible to do heavy DL without some lower back rounding, which is why I personally avoid this as a main lift. Trapbar DLs have been suggested to me, but I haven't really tried them. If I were you, I'd talk with a PT/physician about movements that are safe/healthy to do with your specific injury.
