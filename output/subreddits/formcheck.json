You are both letting the weight fall and using your back to slow the descent. It\u2019s an either or game, with my preference being to just let it fall without any control. Instead of using your lower back, push the bar over your knees and just let it drop back to your starting position.",

Taller people don't \"sit\" as deep.

I know 10 kg isnt a lot, but it doesn't matter. You could even deadlift with a wooden stick and no weight. You need to understand the movement first.\n\nWhat jumps to my eyes is that you are straightening your knees too soon. Don't try to straighten your knees, that's the very last thing to do.Don't focus on completing the movement. Stay in the squat position and try to find the posture that makes it easier to manage the weight. Keep your spine in neutral position, which includes neck and head posture.\n\nAlso you are trying to use your upper back and bring your shoulderblades together correctly, but then as you go up you let go of that tension, your shoulders go forward and you let your lower back do all the work. No wonder your lower back hurts, mine hurts watching this!\n\nHere's the big trick in my opinion: focus on bringing the shoulder blades together, focus at the hinge between your waist and your femurs, and then **pull that bar against your shins**. Seriously. You don't try to lift, you need to try to pull it against your shins. Then start standing up by opening the angle between the quads and the waist. If you go down with your butt  and then do this you will create the appropriate levarage so that you can engage your upper back, distribute the weight better and it won't even feel that heavy. And it will actually make your stronger and improve your posture.\n\nIf you are lacking the range of motion to do this you need to improve your squat, which is usually a slow grind. For quick results in this department point the tip of your feet outwards, stretch your legs, especially calfs, and possibly wear internal heels in your shoes. Also, wear shoes.\n\nAlso, I kinda disagree with the guy saying the problem is how you handle the descent. He is right, the descent is also hurting your back, but I see problems way before that. If you can protect the floor with materasses or something and if people at the gym won't yell at you, you can even drop the weight once you are standing. The exercise is to get to the standing position, the rest is just set up so you can do another rep.",

Squat down to the bar with your legs shoulder length apart and place hands directly outside legs. Square your shoulders and keep it that way during the entire lift. If your shoulders start to slack, stop. You're set is done. Take a deep breath into your gut. Flex the muscles you're about to use a few times ( glutes, hammies, upper back). \nThird step, fuck the weight to the top. Focus on driving your hips between your knees and your chest like you are going in for a power stroke. Clench your glutes at the top but do not lock your knees. Lower the weight back down in the reverse fashion but drop it if you feel pressure on your lower back.",

It is incredibly beneficial, but I often see people expressing this opinion, that it is risky and not very useful. I could not disagree more.\n\nThe problem is if you want to work on your posture there are a lot of things  that you need to work on before you should start to worry about deadlifts. If you don't have a decent core and you can't do a decent squat you should not dead lift. If you do, you could hurt yourself. If you have some of the basis but you try to deadlift with too much weight you will hurt yourself. The amount of weight is not at all crucial for the deadlift. The therapeutic part is in the compound movement. If you have your foundation down and you are humble with the weight but you do the movement wrong, it will still be useless.\n\nIf your posture is at 0 you need to grind your way to a 10 with a number of simple exercises, could be 5, could be 50, depends on how you want to approach things. Once you are up to a 10 you can start deadlifting and you will go from 10 to 100. It is very effective and very satisfying. But it is also demanding, like if your ability to squat gets worse for some reason your deadlift will suffer for it.",
