Also the lean at the starting position and bar placement too close to the body aren't helping with the form. It does look pretty shit, good thing I asked people for advice huh. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, the fix isn't to flare your elbows out to the side, that's just stupid because you would be able to recruit less force. Just bring the elbows forward while keeping the forearms vertical and the wrists straight (this means the wrist stays stacked over the elbow which you're concerned about).",

This might help straighten up the elbows as they look like they\u2019re flaring out slightly. I hope this gives you an extra bit of power behind the push. \nYou kind of sway forward a bit which makes it look like there\u2019s a curve in the back. Have you tried stacking the hips, back, and shoulders? I think you can have a stacked frame and still lean back - I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the leaning back since you\u2019re lifting a decent weight.",

I started at 204 lbs and I am now at a point where I longer feel ashamed of my weight (150-157 lbs the last time I checked as I don't weigh myself a lot). As you can clearly see, I'm not shredded. I don't look the part of an archetypal gym-goer. But getting in the gym and pushing myself to be my best has helped me heal so much of the resentment I held for myself. I have no idea what your struggles are (but please DM me if you want a sounding board), but I promise you. You are going to get through this. The gym may not solve your problems, but it can help you feel strong enough to overcome them. Get back in the gym, friendo! You GOT this!",

Hips go forward with straight legs then as tension builds up in your glutes and hamstrings snap back while pressing up and use the slingshot effect to get the bar moving. You're doing awesome, you've already got great overhead strength and grind so keep working on the technique and your press will blow up once you get hip drive down, you already have the makings of an excellent 2nd lay back!",

                "text": "Lowering the weight will help with making sure your form is correct. You ideally want a weight that you can do 12 reps of and becomes difficult towards the last three reps. By the time you reach your fourth set your last reps should feel the most difficult. Lifting is so much about technique and not the amount of weight. Just imagine just using the bar alone and going Uber slow. It would likely start to feel like you had a lot of weight on that bar. \n\nYou\u2019re lifting 85lbs on your shoulders alone. Now let\u2019s say you split that to 42.5 each shoulder using db. How difficult would it be to do a rep on one shoulder ? Probably really difficult for you. Too difficult. You would like have to compensate with the rest of your body to really lift the weight when your actual intention is to solely focus on the shoulders. I\u2019d say use 5lbs in each side and lift slower and really focus on lifting with your shoulders. \n\nAlso tighten your abs. Your and are the center for all your power, balance and stability. You want to hold them tight like if someone was going to punch your gut and your going to brace for impact. This is going to help with not putting so much pressure on your lower back. And also stabilize your body so you can really concentrate on lifting with your shoulders. \n\nAnyway I hope that helped and I see you going far and completing your goals !",
