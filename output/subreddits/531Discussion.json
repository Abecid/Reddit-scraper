Not really. \nYour doing high reps (in powerlifting 8 is cardio). \nYour form was almost identical on the 7th rep as it was on the first. The 8th you just clearly knew you were done.\n\nYour hips didn't shoot up, you looked to be bracing well. The weight wasn't pulling you forward or travelling in an arc which means you have the bar in the correct position and are not bleeding power. \n\nAnd if you were doing sat 3 reps (heavier weight) I'm sure you would look more explosive. But when doing high reps work you wanna conserve energy for the end of your set, not just throw the bar around.\n\nKeep working like that, the weights will go up. I Imagine your 1 rep max is around 200. Which you look what 85 kilos? Your're doing great.",
